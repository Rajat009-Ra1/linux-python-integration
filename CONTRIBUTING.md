# Contributing guidelines
## Before contributing

Welcome to The teknoboost/linux-python-integration! Before sending your pull requests, make sure that you read the whole guidelines. If you have any doubt on the contributing guide, please feel free to state it clearly in an issue or ask the community in TeknoBoost.

## Contributor

We are very happy that you consider implementing algorithms and data structure for others! This repository is referenced and used by learners from all over the globe. Being one of our contributors, you agree and confirm that:

You did your work - no plagiarism allowed
Any plagiarized work will not be merged.
Your work will be distributed under teknoboost your pull request is merged
You submitted work fulfils or mostly fulfils our styles and standards

New implementation is welcome! For example, new solutions for a problem, different representations for a graph data structure or algorithm designs with different complexity.

Improving comments and writing proper tests are also highly welcome.

## Contribution

We appreciate any contribution, from fixing a grammar mistake in a comment to implementing complex algorithms. Please read this section if you are contributing your work.
After you have submitted your pull request, you should see the Travis tests start to run at the bottom of your submission page. If those tests fail, then click on the details button try to read through the Travis output to understand the failure. If you do not understand, please leave a comment on your submission page and a community member will try to help.


## Other Requirements for Submissions
The file extension for code files should be .py. Jupyter Notebooks should be submitted to TheAlgorithms/Jupyter.

Strictly use snake_case (underscore_separated) in your file_name, as it will be easy to parse in future using scripts.

Please avoid creating new directories if at all possible. Try to fit your work into the existing directory structure.

If possible, follow the standard within the folder you are submitting to.

If you have modified/added code work, make sure the code compiles before submitting.

If you have modified/added documentation work, ensure your language is concise and contains no grammar errors.

Add a corresponding explanation to Code-Explanation (Optional but recommended).

All submissions will be tested with mypy so we encourage to add Python type hints where it makes sense to do so.

Most importantly,
        Be consistent in the use of these guidelines when submitting.
        Happy coding!.
